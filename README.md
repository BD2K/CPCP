The Center for Predictive Computational Phenotyping is focused on significantly advancing the state
of the art in computational methods for transforming large, heterogeneous, high-dimensional data sources
into predictive models for biomedicine. Specifically, we are focusing on a broad range of problems that
can be cast as computational phenotyping. The term phenotype, which is derived from the Greek word phainein meaning
“to show”, refers to the observable properties of an organism that result from the interaction of its genotype and its environment.
